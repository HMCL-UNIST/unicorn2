This is the basic upper plate designed to be mounted on the SRX chassis.

## Design Features

The SRX chassis does not have screw holes or mounting points at the front for attaching supports, so standoff bolts are used to prop up the plate.

Since all components are mounted on the plate and the IMU sensor is attached to the underside, appropriately sized standoff bolts and nuts must be used to prevent interference.

## Closing

This post shares the basic upper plate design for mounting a NUC and VESC on the SRX chassis. Proper standoff bolt and nut lengths should be selected to avoid interference between components.
