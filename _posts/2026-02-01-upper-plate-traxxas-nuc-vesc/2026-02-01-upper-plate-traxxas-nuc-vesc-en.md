This upper plate is designed for use with a NUC as the onboard PC, mounted on the Traxxas chassis.

## Design Features

Unlike the SRX, the Traxxas chassis does not have enough space beneath the upper plate to place the VESC, so it must be mounted on top of the plate.

Since there is no dedicated space for cable management, cables should be routed beneath the plate while ensuring they do not interfere with or cause friction against the center drive shaft.

The NUC has a relatively large width, so sufficiently long standoff bolts and nuts are needed to allow easy battery insertion.

## Easy Battery Version

If you want to minimize the standoff bolt/nut length to lower the center of gravity as much as possible, you can use this version instead.

- [F1tenth_NUC_easy_battery.STL]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/posts/upper-plate-traxxas-nuc-vesc/F1tenth_NUC_easy_battery.stl)

This version has a wider battery opening and added chamfers for easier battery replacement.

## Closing

This post shares the upper plate design for mounting a NUC and VESC on the Traxxas chassis. You can choose between the standard version and the Easy Battery version depending on your battery replacement convenience needs.
