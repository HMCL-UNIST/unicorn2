## Design Features

The VESC is mounted on the chassis base plate for a lower center of gravity, and the upper plate is designed to secure the remaining components.

## Pinion Gear Access Hole

The center hole allows access to the motor's pinion gear without disassembling the upper plate, in case the gear mesh is too tight.

## Battery Retention

The holes near the battery compartment are designed for Velcro tape to prevent the battery from falling out during driving.

## Cable Management Holes

The holes at the center of the plate are designed for routing and organizing cables, and can be utilized in various ways.
