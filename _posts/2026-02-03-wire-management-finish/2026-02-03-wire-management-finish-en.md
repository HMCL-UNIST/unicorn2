With all major parts mounted on the chassis and top plate, tidy the wiring to prevent interference or disconnection during driving. Follow the steps below to route and secure cables by available spaces.

## System Layout Before Tying

After assembling the top plate, we reviewed the overall wiring flow. The diagram is for reference only.

## Using the Space Beside the Servo

The VESC power harness is routed through the open space next to the servo so it reaches the battery bay directly. Extra slack is fixed with silicone tape.

## Using the Underside of the Top Plate

NUC and servo power cables are taped to the underside of the top plate, and the Matek BEC is fixed in the empty space next to the lower BEC with silicone tape.

## Using the Chassis Structure

Motor phase and sensor cables run close to the shaft, so we used the chassis ribs as anchor points and tied them down to prevent contact during driving.

*Cable ties on chassis ribs keep motor lines clear of the shaft*

## Using Remaining Space Above the Top Plate

After closing the top plate, leftover cables are coiled into the remaining space and fixed to stop movement.

## Battery Mounting Method

- We use Velcro straps and foam so the battery will not wobble during driving.

- Battery leads are aligned toward the chassis to avoid interference with moving parts.

*Straps and cable alignment keep the pack and leads stable*

## Wrap-up

Effective wire management hinges on minimizing interference and securing every cable. We leveraged free space (around the servo, under/above the top plate, along chassis ribs) to distribute routes, then locked them with cable ties or silicone tape. A final check that the battery and power leads do not contact moving parts completes the car for driving.
