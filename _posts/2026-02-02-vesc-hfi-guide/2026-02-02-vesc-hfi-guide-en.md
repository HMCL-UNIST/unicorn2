![VESC HFI overview](/assets/img/posts/vesc-hfi-guide-new/overview.png)

HFI helps VESC estimate rotor position more accurately at low speed for sensorless motors. It doesn’t dramatically change overall performance, but it **improves low‑speed precision** and can provide an advantage at race starts.

## Cautions when using HFI

- There are basic HFI and Silent modes (45 Deg/Coupled), and both produce continuous ultrasonic noise while active.
- Because very high‑frequency current is injected, keeping HFI active too long can **overheat the motor**, potentially deforming mounts or damaging the chassis.
- Noise and heat can be significant during setup, so **test briefly** and monitor temperature.
- When tuned well, low‑speed performance reaches about 95% of sensored motors, but you may still see occasional stutter (roughly 1 in 10 starts).
- Avoid long low‑speed runs with HFI enabled. Even without driving, continuous joystick signals (auto‑repeat) can keep HFI active and stress the motor and chassis.

## Wrap-up

HFI is a useful tool for improving low‑speed sensorless control, but heat and noise are real concerns. Use short tests, watch for overheating, and stop immediately if abnormal heat or vibration appears.
